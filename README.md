# Hello, I am Ricealicious

I mostly just use GitHub to stash away my course assignments and notes; however, I have plans on eventually starting my own personal projects while also contributing to open-source projects whenever I can!

- I absolutely love looking through everyone's dotfiles. They are so pretty.
- Currently learning Java though if I'm being honest I would rather go back to C++.

Update (11/7/2021): I am thinking of creating my own OS. Once I start, I will likely revise this README.

# Hello, I am Ricealicious
I am a Sophomore at the University of Texas at Dallas. Other than that is not really much that I can think of to include in this "about me."

# What I am currently working on
- I am learning Rust and am planning to create a repository to store my progress.
- Overall, I am planning on improving my technical skills.

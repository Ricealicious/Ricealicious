# Hello, I am Ricealicious

I mostly just use GitHub to stash away my course assignments and notes; however, I have plans on eventually starting my own personal projects while also contributing to open-source projects whenever I can!

- I absolutely love looking through everyone's dotfiles. They are so pretty.
- Currently learning Java.
